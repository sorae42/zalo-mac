## Why?
The Zalo app on macOS has some styling issue that make it look less like a macOS app, and this will change that. (Yes, details are my pet peeves)

This is not intended for browser or Windows app. You don't have to use this if you are happy with the appearance of the app.

## What about my data?
Your data is completely untouched. Feel free to look at the code if you don't trust the app. Or don't use this, at all.

## What changed?
- [ ] Titlebar is completely removed.
- [ ] Add like, 4px to the sidebar width so it aligns up with the traffic light buttons. (don't ask me why this is a problem for me)
- [ ] Make most of the top elements draggable.
