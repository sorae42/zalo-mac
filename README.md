## Why?
The Zalo app on macOS has some styling issue that make it look less like a macOS app, and this will change that.

This is not intended for browser or Windows app. You don't have to use this if you are happy with the appearance of the app.

Also, this is not an attempt to make Zalo a native macOS app. Through it'd be nice if one actually exists instead of this bloated Electron app.

## What about my data?
Your data is completely untouched. Feel free to look at the code if you don't trust the app. Or don't use this, at all.

## What changed?
- [ ] Titlebar is completely removed.
- [ ] ^ This will push the top of the sidebar to the top so we would add a divide with a height of 20px.
- [ ] Add like, 4px to the sidebar so it aligns up with the traffic light buttons.
- [ ] Make most of the top elements draggable.
